        </li>
        <h4>3. Data collected from our partners</h4>
        <p>When you access the Services through any third party services such as social networking
            sites (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Google) or from any mobile devices, you allow us access to

            played by you, information related to the interaction of you with the Services and with
            other users, and so forth.</p>
        <p>We may also use various third party advertising and marketing partners to assist us on

        <p>By accepting this Privacy Policy and downloading or continuing to use the Services, you
            consent to us and our advertising and marketing partners collecting and using

            suppliers who process personal information on our behalf to take appropriate security
            measures.</p>
        <p>In order to keep the Service and its social features safe and fair, to fight fraud and to

            information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
        <h4>2. Other users</h4>

        <p>Any user who receives any information including personally identifiable information, from
            another user shall not disclose or use such information, save where expressly permitted
            by that user or save where such information has ceased to be of a confidential nature.
            In any event, we shall not be liable for any unauthorized disclosure or use by another
            user or other person of any content.</p>
        <h4>3. Partners working for us</h4>

            such information to public authorities if required to do so by law, or in the good faith
            belief that such action is necessary to comply with all and any applicable laws, or
            where it is pursuant to we are required to respond to a governmental, regulatory,
            administrative or court order or directive, a subpoena or a search warrant, or to combat
            fraud and illegal activity.</p>
        <p>We also reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or
            non-personally-identifiable information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate
            or necessary to enforce the Agreement, take precautions against liability, to
            investigate and defend against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
            government authorities and enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of
            the Services, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ourselves, our
            users or others.</p>

        <p>If you have questions about data protection, or any requests for resolving issues with
            your personal data, we encourage you to primarily contact us through the game so we can
            reply to you more quickly. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable time
            frame.</p>
        <h4>V.&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h4>

            collected, stored, used in any country and/or transferred to any country in the world.
            Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own
            country, we will try to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your
            data.</p>
        <h4>&nbsp;VI. SPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS</h4>
        <p>The use of the Website and Services and this Privacy Policy is governed by and shall be
            construed and enforced under the laws of Hong Kong, without applying any conflicts of
            law principles that would require application of the law of any other jurisdiction. You
            agree to submit to the personal non-exclusive jurisdiction in Hong Kong and any other
            court of competent jurisdiction chosen by us.</p>
        <p>In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Privacy Policy,
            including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, (a “Dispute”),
            we strongly encourage that a resolution first be sought through our Feedback system
            within APP.</p>
        <p>You agree that in the event that a resolution is not obtained through our Feedback system
            within APP, such Dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Hong Kong
            Court.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, you agree that we are entitled to submit such
            Dispute for resolution through any other dispute resolution mechanism including the
            courts of any jurisdiction and we shall further be entitled to seek any injunctive or
            other equitable relief in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you, without
            any obligations of providing any bond or surety or proof of damages.</p>
        <p>You irrevocably waive all rights to seek any injunctive or other equitable relief or to
            enjoin or restrain the operation or exploitation of the Services or any part thereof.
            You further irrevocably waive all rights to a class or representative action or as a
            named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney
            general action.</p>
        <h4>VII.&nbsp;OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN</h4>
        <p>The Services are not intended to be accessed by persons under the age of 13, nor do we
            knowingly collect or solicit personal data therefrom. In the event that we learn that we
            have inadvertently gathered personally identifiable information from persons under the
            ages set out below, we will take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that such
            information is removed from our records.</p>
        <h4>VIII. DATA SECURITY</h4>
        <p>We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve
            the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or
            warrant the security of any information you disclose on, through or within the Services
            and you do so entirely at your own risk. Please note that we cannot guarantee that such
            information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of
            our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
        <p>If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so
            that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice on our website if a
            security breach occurs.</p>
        <p>If you create an account with the Apps, you will be required to select a password that
            can be changed at any time after you first log into the account by using your current
            password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
            password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and
            password or your account with any other third party service. You agree to (i) notify us
            immediately if you are aware or reasonably suspect of any unauthorized use of your
            account or password or of any unauthorized access of the Services through your account,
            and (ii) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.</p>
        <h4>IX. MERGER, ACQUISITION, SALE OR INSOLVENCY</h4>
        <p>1. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with another entity, we reserve the
            right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer the information or assign our rights
            to the information that we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition,
            sale, or other change of control.</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp;In the event of our insolvency, reorganization, receivership, winding-up or
            assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable
            principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your
            personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
